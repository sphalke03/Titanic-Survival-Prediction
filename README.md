# Titanic-Survival-Prediction
Titanic Survival Prediction

Objective
Create a Predictive model that predicts the survivability of passengers on the Titanic with Data Science techniques in Python

Steps

Data Preparation
Upload the file of all passengers from Titanic The column details present in the dataset are as follows 
Passenger class, Age, sex and ticketFast_train: a text file with fields "fare passenger_survived"DOCTYPE DEFAULT SYSTEMDEPENDENCIES/LINKSAPI.DEFAULT.GOOGLE.COMAPolynomialThis Fare field is no longer available because it contains interactions or identifiers of API entities

Data Cleaning
Clean the data in order to fill any missing values and make sure all categorical features are encoded using an acceptable encoding format for each mode. This step Verifies that you have got all the data records required for analysProcessing Data is useful when part of a record in not available?3. Feature Engineering

Feature Extraction
Create new features or modify existing ones to improve the performance of the model. This step often involves encoding categorical variables and scaling numerical features.

Model Training
Train a classification model on the training data. Given example uses Logistic Regression which is simple and useful for binary classification problems.

Evaluation
Based on the test data, you can assess the trained model using measures like accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score. This step is useful in the determination of how well a model works.
